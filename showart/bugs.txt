Load in a 4 color png.  Hit save.  It says "Only 8 and 24 bit BMP files are supported.  Then it writes an empty file and crashes/exits 

FIXED  PROBLEM:  Jpeg library-save only supports 8 or 24 bit bitmaps.  SO -- check bitDepth BEFORE calling save!!!!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG: file save/save as with no images loaded crashes
FIXED: Check for condition and put up a message box.  Graying the save and save as would have been more elegant but I don't want to spend the time figuring it out!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feature Request -- ADDED!!
add a checkbox to OpenFile dialog.  If true ALL files in the chosen file's directory are opened.
The value of the checkbox is persisted in Preferences

Dir with 10,000 files takes forever to open.

Problem must be in DibEntry::Set()  CFile -- opens the file.  Perhaps defer until load time?
FIXED - CFile was opening every file and running hundreds of lines of code.  Total waste.
Removed CFile call.  Unneeded
------------------------------------------------------------
BUG - Everytime you select ONE file in a directory, all files are loaded but the file you clicked
is loaded TWICE
FIXED!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURE -- put super-skip, super-delete on menu
