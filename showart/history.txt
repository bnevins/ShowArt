Version 4.0
What a nightmare!  I spent about FIFTEEN hours whipping the hideous jpeg code until it finally bent to my will.

You can now save jpeg files directly in Showart!

Currently -- do a File/Save As and give it a filename with ".jpg" or ".jpeg".  (If you give the filename extension as bmp -- you will get the usual gigantic bmp file).

If you press the little "save" icon or choose File/Save -- it will instantly overwrite your original file with a fresh copy using your Quality factor.  So be careful!

Go to File/Preferences to set the JPEG Quality (I allow anything from 25-95).

If you press the little "save" icon or choose File/Save -- it will overwrite your original with a fresh copy using your Quality factor.  So be careful!

Once you set this *all* jpeg saves will use that quality.

I did some experimenting.  With smaller images from the internet (you know:  puppies, duckies, kittens, etc.) you need a bigger quality factor.

For huge digital pictures from your camera I can start to detect a difference once the Quality goes under 50.  If you pick a number greater than 75 - it will produce a file BIGGER than the original.  I would only use > 75 for writing an important jpeg from a .bmp file.

You can easily experiment by getting a test jpg and then saving it with different names after changing the quality each time.

Massive change to Key Commands Dialog:
-- Added Delete Scheme button
-- Copy/Move/Index/List are selectable for every key

   I.e. When it is checked -- the dialog box appears with the exact message.  
   if it's unchecked -- no dialog box appears, and the file is skipped.
  
version 6.5 -- Fixed bug where CD files could not be viewed.

version 7.0 -- added a hot key for Save As

version 7.1:


1) Did you know:  put a "$" as the first character of a key command and the "rootdir" will replace it.

e.g. the root dir is:  "c:\robsporn\hugeGlassObjectsinPussy"

Set "B" to "$\best".  This resolves to "c:\robsporn\hugeGlassObjectsinPussy\best"

===========

I'm tired of constantly changing the rootdir in order to have "best", "awesome", whatever directories

New Feature in 7.1:

If you start a key command with "%" then the root-dir is ignored.  Instead it uses the directory of the current picture.

E.g. if you are looking at "C:\scubatrip23" and you set a key command to "%manta" then the file will go to "C:\scubatrip23\manta" and the rootdir is ignored.

=================

7.2:  

Now in List mode the drive letter is stripped off
